This was a really fun, and challenging test, thanks!

Some things I'd have done if I had more time...

 - Additional unit test coverage for ProductsSvc cache
 - Side-fade animation for removing an item which may be challenging since delete doesn't remove an item, instead it
   removes it from the cache which updates the model.
 - Search button and filtering
 - Custom filter for splitting dollars and cents so that they can be styled differently
